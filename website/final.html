         I'm a huge fan of escape rooms - they're incredibly immersive in real
         life and contain so many interesting puzzles and riddles. Due to 
         ongoing circumstances, we unfortunately can't go to escape rooms irl. 
         what better way to simulate one than by making one in VR?

         This escape room contains three separate stages: Hidden Switches, Rube 
         Goldberg, and Travel Trivia. I don't want to spoil the puzzles, so 
         all of the following information has spoiler tags. Hover to uncover the 
         solution. 

         <div class="section-wrapper switches">
            <h3>
               <span>1. Hidden Switches</span>
            </h3>
            The objective of this room is to 
            <span class="spoiler">
               find two switches
            </span>
            to unlock the door to the next room. 
            
            <div class="switch switch-2">
               Switch 1: 
               <span class="spoiler">
                  underneath the table
               </span>

            </div>
            <div class="switch switch-2">
               Switch 2: 
               <div class="spoiler">
                  <span class="bold">
                     solve the riddle.
                  </span>
                  <span>
                     door on the left leads to inferno, door on the 
                     right leads to lion that hasn't eaten in three months. you open
                     the right door because the lion is (realistically) dead after not
                     eating for so long. this means you choose the right painting, 
                     which has a switch behind it.

            <h3>2. Rube Goldberg</h3>
            The objective of this room is to 
            <span class="spoiler">
               use the rube goldberg machine to trigger the switch with the ball
               in the room.

         <div class="section-wrapper travel">
            <h3>3. Travel Trivia</h3>
            The objective of this room is to 
            <span class="spoiler">
               get a 4 digit code
            </span>. This is by far the hardest room. 

            <div class="hint">
               Hint 1: 
               <div class="spoiler">
                  The first picture on the wall shows the order of which the digits 
                  go. You must solve all the puzzles but combine the digits in that 
                  order.
               </div>

            </div>
            <div class="hint">
               Hint 2:
               <div class="spoiler">
                  The first picture is of the Great Wall. This is located in China.
                  The capital of Beijing is China, so the digit for this puzzle is 7.
               </div>
            </div>
            <div class="hint">
               Hint 3:
               <div class="spoiler">
                  The second picture is of a chess board. The objective is to put the 
                  king into checkmate in 1 move. The move is e7#, add 4 to the last 
                  number to get e11, and locate the result on the world map on the 
                  wall. You get a square that contains Italy, which has a capital of 
                  Rome, so the digit is 4. 
               </div>
            </div>
            <div class="hint">
               Hint 4:
               <div class="spoiler">
                  The third picture is of oranges. There's a table of 17 oranges, and
                  because the vitamin most commonly associated with oranges is vitamin
                  c, you get c17. That square on the world map contains Russia, which
                  has a capital of Moscow, so the resulting digit is 6.
               </div>
            </div>
            <div class="hint">
               Hint 5:
               <div class="spoiler">
                  The fourth picture shows a picture of a puzzle. There's a 4-piece
                  puzzle on the table, and when you rearrange them, you get the 
                  Indonesian flag. The capital is Jakarta, which means the digit is 7.
